## Event Report
By : Simron Bhuyan
- Blockchain technology is growing at a fast rate and its growth is not going to saturate anytime soon. In such a time it was wonderful to know about this technology from someone well experienced like our very own alumnus Swapnil Kole, Lead Engineer, SuperWorld. Earlier blockchain felt only about crypto currencies, but there is a lot more to it. We got to learn about immutable ledgers, smart contracts, dapplications, DeFi and so much more. From learning the basics of blockchain technology to knowing how to land a job in the field, everything was covered in the workshop. The code along sessions were interactive and a fun part of the 10 hours. Swapnil bhaiya's personal journey throughout the 4 years of college and his consistency towards landing a job provided immense motivation to us. His guidance on how to navigate college was highly admired. Earliar blockchain felt like it's something out of my scope but now it seems so much simpler and something that we can actually do if we are dedicated to it. The two days of blockchain session were definitely well spent.
